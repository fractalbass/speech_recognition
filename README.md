# speech_recognition

Correctly folding a fitted sheet is just a sequence of steps. (Check out Martha Stewarts' video.) We can think of this sequence of steps (and the probability of making the correct next move at each step) as a Markov Chain. If we combined Markov Chains with a time frequency domain tool called Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, and throw in a little machine learning along the way, we have the necessary tools to create a speech recognizer. (See my blog post on Fourier transforms for more info about analyzing time frequency domain of audio signals.)
